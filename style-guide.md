- Simple Omelette Recipe

- An easy and quick dish, perfect for any meal. This classic omelette combines beaten eggs cooked to perfection, optionally filled with your choice of cheese, vegetables, or meats.

- Preparation time

- Total: Approximately 10 minutes
- Preparation: 5 minutes
- Cooking: 5 minutes

- Ingredients

- 2-3 large eggs
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 1 tablespoon of butter or oil
- Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs

- Instructions

- Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.

- Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.

- Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.

- Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.

- Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.

- Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
